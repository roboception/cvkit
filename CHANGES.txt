
Version 1.7.0 (26th October 2015)
---------------------------------

- Reduced requirement for OpenGL from 3.0 to 2.1 (i.e. GLSL 1.3 to 1.2).
  This permits successful compilation on Mac.
- The code for watching file changes via inotify has been made optional so that
  cvkit also compiles on systems that do support it, e.g. Mac.
- rainbow color mapping in sv is adapted to min/max intensity range, but will
  always be a power of 10.
- sv now has the additional parameter -scale for setting the initial image
  scale factor.
- imgcmd now has parameter -jet for converting disparity images into colored
  versions for visualization.
- Captured images in sv are now stored without a possible black border.
- Fixed bug when storing pgm, ppm or pfm under Windows.
- Some minor bugfixes.

Version 1.6.6 (8th June 2015)
-----------------------------

- cmake config files will be installed together with libs for further
  development.

Version 1.6.2 - 1.6.5 (18th May 2015)
-------------------------------------

- Removed "using namespace" declarations
- Minor changes and bugfixes

Version 1.6.1 (16th February 2015)
----------------------------------

sv:
- Bugfix for 0.5 pixel shift error.

Version 1.6.0 (19th December 2014)
----------------------------------

sv:
- If GDAL is compiled in, then the EXIF_Orientation tag that is given in jpeg
  images is used for automatic image rotation and flipping.
- 'f' flips the image horizontally.
- 'd' renames the current image by adding ".bak" and removes it from the list.
- 't' shows smoothed images that are computed by trilinear interpolation.
- Some internal changes.

Version 1.5.1 (14th November 2014)
----------------------------------

- Internal cleanup.

Version 1.5.0 (16th September 2014)
-----------------------------------

- sv can now show individual color channels (see help).
- Header files and libs can optionally be installed for further development.
- Bugfix: Starting sv with a single image that does not exist caused showing
  all other images in that directory. An error is shown now.
- Internal cleanup.

Version 1.4.1 (11th July 2014)
------------------------------

- Minor bug fixes.

Version 1.4.0 (16th June 2014)
------------------------------

plyv:
- 's' toggles between shading in grey and special colors. Each object gets an
  individual color, which helps comparing data sets.
- 'b' toggles backface culling on (default) and off.
- <tab> toggle between color schemes.
- In the Middlebury naming convention, calib.txt is loaded automatically as
  camera definition file. If calib.txt is not specified explicitely, then the
  cameras are hidden by default and shown by pressing 'k'.
- Reduced requirement for OpenGL from 3.3 to 3.0 (i.e. GLSL 3.3 to 1.3).
- Some bugs fixed.

Version 1.3.0 (6th June 2014)
-----------------------------

- Reduced requirement for cmake from 2.8.10 to 2.8.9.
- Documentation improved.
- Some bugs fixed.

Version 1.2.0 (6th June 2014)
-----------------------------

- Reduced requirement for cmake from 2.8.12 to 2.8.10.
- Added -sub and -div options to imgcmd.

Version 1.1.0 (5th June 2014)
-----------------------------

all:
- Added an installer for Windows.
- Optional support for reading and writing png in 8 and 16 bit using libpng.
- Makes sure that normals have length 1 when reading PLY files.
- Some bugs fixed.
- Documentation updated.

plyv:
- plyview has been renamed to plyv to avoid conflicts with other software
- Support for Middlebury naming convention and calib file format for on the fly
  3d visualization of ground truth datasets.
- If *.txt files are given, these files are loaded as parameters of cameras,
  that are visualized using pyramids.
- Captured images are now saved lossless in PNG format if libpng is compiled
  in. Otherwise, if GDAL is available, tif is used. As fallback, saving as ppm
  is used.

sv:
- If only one image is given as argument, then additionally to showing this
  image, all other images of the same directory can be selected by the left and
  right cursor keys.
- Showing the image name including path (if given) in the window title.
- Increased speed of zooming and panning using OpenMP.
- Captured images are saved as PNG by default, as in plyv (see above).

Version 1.0.0 (5th May 2014)
----------------------------

- First public release.
