
INSTALLING CVKIT
----------------

--- Windows ---

There is a windows package with pre-compiled binaries and an installer. Since
sv.exe and plyv.exe only have a simple GUI, images and PLY files must be
provided as parameters when starting the tools. The installer will
automatically add file associations, such that a double click to a PLY file
will start plyv.exe with that file as parameter. Similarly a double click to
PFM, PGM, PPM, TIF, JPG, PNG or VRT file will automatically open it with
sv.exe.

For opening more than one file at once, a link to plyv.exe and sv.exe can be
manually created on the desktop. Selecting several files, dragging and dropping
them on the icon will start plyv.exe or sv.exe with all those files.

--- Compiling Source Code under Linux, Windows or Mac ---

For compiling the source code, the following tools and packages are
required:

- Linux with kernel version >= 2.6.27 or Windows >= XP
- cmake (>= 2.8.9, although older version might work if you change the minimum
  requirement at the top of the main CMakeLists.txt file)
- g++ compiler (>= 4.1.2, although older versions might work)
- X11 or Windows for building sv.
- OpenGL 2.1, GLEW and GLUT for building plyv.

Optionally, the following libraries are used if available:

- libjpeg for loading and saving JPG images with 8 bits per color.
- libpng for loading and saving PNG files with 8 or 16 bits per color.
- GDAL (www.gdal.org) is used for loading many different scientific raster
  formats. It also supports loading and saving TIFF images with 8 or 16 bit
  integer or 32 bit floating point values.

If none of these libraries are available, only PGM, PPM and PFM are
supported for loading and saving images.

For compiling cvkit, just extract the source package, go to the main
directory and type:

> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> (optionally 'ccmake ..' if you want to change some build options)
> make
> make install
